		<p><i>Marijuana</i>—which can also be called cannabis, weed, pot, or dope—refers to the dried flowers, leaves, stems, and seeds of the cannabis plant. The cannabis plant contains more than 100 compounds (or cannabinoids). These compounds include tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is impairing or mind-altering, as well as other active compounds, such as cannabidiol (CBD). CBD is not impairing, meaning it does not cause a “high”.<sup>1</sup></p>

		<p><i>Marijuana</i> is the most commonly used federally illegal drug in the United States, with an estimated 48.2 million people using it in 2019.<sup>2</sup> <i>Marijuana</i> use may have a wide range of health effects on the body and brain.
