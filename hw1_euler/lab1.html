			<h1>Euler, Leonhard</h1>
			<h3>(1707-1783)</h3>
			<hr>
			<p>The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, <b>Leonhard Euler</b> was born in Basel, Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant of mathematics, <b>Jean Bernoulli</b>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler was the most prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over <i>800 different books and papers</i>. His influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well. Euler's work on mathematical analysis, <i>Introductio in analysin infinitorum</i> (1749) remained a standard textbook for well over a century. For the princes of Anhalt-Dessau he wrote <i>Lettres &#224; une princesse d'Allemagne</i> (1768-1772), giving a clear non-technical outline of the main physical theories of the time.</p>
			<p>One can hardly write mathematical equations without copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such as <i>e</i> and <i>&pi;</i>, were developed by Euler. He is perhaps best known for his research into mathematical analysis. Euler's formula:</p>
			<p><center>cos(<i>x</i>) + <i>i</i>sin(<i>x</i>) = <i>e</i><sup>(<i>ix</i>)</sup></center></p>
			<p>demonstrates the relationship between analysis, trignometry and imaginary numbers, in one beautiful and elegant equation.</p>
			<p>Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed in the annals of mathematics.</p>
