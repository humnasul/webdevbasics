		<p>Parathon</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Parathon is a sporting event, in which participants traverse an entire country by 		running and using a variety of sporting equipment, such as Kayaks, Canoes and Bicycles. 		Last year the event was held in Cura&#231;ao, and was a resounding success. We hope to 		have the same success this year. The entry fee for this year has been set to 500, and four 		countries are vying for the honor of hosting our cross country event:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>USA</li>
			<li>South Africa</li>
			<li>Malaysia</li>
			<li>Thailand</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We would like to congratulate Pablo Mart&#237;nez, last year's winner. The following 		are the players, who scored the top three positions:</p>
		<ol>
