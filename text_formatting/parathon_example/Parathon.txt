Parathon
Parathon is a sporting event, in which participants traverse an entire country by running and using a variety of sporting equipment, such as Kayaks, Canoes and Bicycles. Last year the event was held in Curacao, and was a resounding success. We hope to have the same success this year. The entry fee for this year has been set to 500, and four countries are vying for the honor of hosting our cross country event:
USA
South Africa
Malaysia
Thailand
We would like to congratulate Pablo Martinez, last year's winner. The following are the players, who scored the top three positions:
Pablo Martinez (Spain)
Victor Koncenko (Russia)
Miles Smith (England)
